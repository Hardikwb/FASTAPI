| Join Type           | What it returns        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **LEFT JOIN**       | All A + A intersection b
| **LEFT ANTI JOIN**  | A-(A intersection b)
| **RIGHT JOIN**      | All B + A intersection b     |
| **RIGHT ANTI JOIN** | B-(A intersection b)

Super-easy memory trick
JOIN → keeps the whole table
ANTI JOIN → removes the intersection
LEFT → focus on A
RIGHT → focus on B

-- SELECT * FROM products

-- SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price

-- SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price*inventory,name
-- or
-- SELECT *,price * inventory AS total_value FROM products ORDER BY total_value DESC, name ASC,price DESC;

-- Sorts first by price * inventory (total value)
-- Default order is ASC (lowest → highest)
-- Then sorts by name for rows with the same total value

-- to skip first n result we use offset n
-- select * from products ORDER BY id DESC limit 5 OFFSET 2


-- insert into products (name,price,inventory) values('tortilla',2352,5)

-- select * from products where name like 'tortilla'

-- insert into products (name,price,inventory) values('Activa',110002,5) returning *;
